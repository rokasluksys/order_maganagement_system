backend:

	orders:
		create,
		read,
		update,
		delete
		
	users:
		create,
		read,
		update? (perhaps to change password in case password is forgotten, but I'd need to add email verification for that),
		delete (then I'd need to implement admin user who can delete all notes, which is a good idea probably)
		
	login:
		
	register:
		for general users (admin users could be created by the admin raising priviledges of an existing user)
		
frontend:
	
	registration page:
		first user created is admin, others are basic
		
	login page:
		
	
	order page:
		general view (users can only see their own orders, admin can see everyones),
		search function,
		creating function,
		editing function,
		deletion function
		
	account center page?:
		change name,
		change password
		delete account
